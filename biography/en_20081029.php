His innovations and reputation made him the obvious choice for special projects. &nbsp;Both the governments of Canada and of Qu&eacute;bec selected Perry to produce the multi-media presentations for their respective Expo &rsquo;67 host pavilion.&nbsp; The organizing committee of the Olympic Games (COJO) asked him to produce the music of the opening &amp; closing ceremonies for the <strong>1976 Montreal Olympic Games</strong>.
